      Welcome to CookMyFridge! We are a passionate team of computer engineers and a computer scientist dedicated to making a positive impact on people's lives and the environment. Our mission is to reduce food waste and provide personalized recipe solutions for individuals with dietary restrictions.

      At CookMyFridge, we understand the struggle of staring at a nearly empty fridge and wondering what to cook with the limited ingredients available. That's why we developed an innovative automated recipe website that takes the guesswork out of meal planning. Our platform generates customized recipes based on the ingredients users already have in their fridges, allowing them to make delicious meals without the need for additional grocery shopping.
