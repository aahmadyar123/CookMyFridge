## Overview

### Summary

This project was developed as part of CSC 307 Intro to Software Engineering instructed by Professor BJ Klingenberg. Technologies used in this project are React on the frontend, Node.js and Express on the backend, and MongoDB for the database. Development took place over three sprints (two weeks each). We went through the entire software development lifecycle from planning and design to implementation and deployment. We also implemented CI/CD with Github Actions and Azure.

Key Features:

## Contributing

Here are all of the steps you should follow whenever contributing to this repo!

### Making Changes

1. Before you start making changes, always make sure you're on the main branch, then `git pull` and `npm i` on both frontend and backend to make sure your code is up to date
2. Create a branch with the name relating to the change you will make `git checkout -b <name-of-branch>`
3. Make changes to the code
4. `npm run test` in the backend and react-frontend subfolder to ensure code standards. (running `npx prettier --write .` will fix most of the styling errors)

### Commiting Changes

When interacting with Git/GitHub, feel free to use the command line, VSCode extension, or Github desktop. These steps assume you have already made a branch using `git checkout -b <branch-name>` and you have made all neccessary code changes for the provided task.

1. View diffs of each file you changed using the VSCode Github extension (3rd icon on far left bar of VSCode) or GitHub Desktop
2. `git add .` (to stage all files) or `git add <file-name>` (to stage specific file)
3. `git commit -m " <description>"` or
   `git commit` to get a message prompt
4. `git push -u origin <name-of-branch>`
5. Check the [Github Actions](https://github.com/bbmcmann/307MovieProject/actions) page to ensure all workflows are successful

### Making Pull Requests

1. Go to the Pull Requests tab on [github.com](https://github.com/luisdavidgarcia/CookMyFridge/pulls)
2. Find your PR, and provide a description of your change, steps to test it, and any other notes.
3. Link your PR to the corresponding **Issue**
4. Request a reviewer to check your code
5. Once approved, your code is ready to be merged in üéâ
